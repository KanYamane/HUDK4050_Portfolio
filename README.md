**A Brief Explanation on the Final Project**  
The project was conducted with Pooja Addla and Nikita Tejwani. Our data of interest was collected at Community Impac, an adult learning program which helps students pass the GED test (equivalent of a high school degree). The data was on student's performance in previous TABE tests, a test on Language, Mathematics, and Reading which serves as a precursor for the GED exam. We proposed using a K-means clustering model to group the students together into optimal tutoring groups. We also discussed potential strategies for data cleaning, and other questions of interest that we could research in the future.
